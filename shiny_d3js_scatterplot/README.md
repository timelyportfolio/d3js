R/Shiny Adaptation of [Mike Bostock's Amazing Interactive Scatterplot](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4063663)
===========================================================================================================

Another quick example of how we can improve amazing d3 visualizations by adding the power of [R](http://r-project.org) and [Shiny](http://rstudio.com/shiny).  I wish that I knew how to fork a Gist into a Github repo to insure that I get no credit for this wonderful visualization.

From the [original example's](http://gist.github.com/4063663) Readme.md:

"The scatterplot matrix visualizations pairwise correlations for multi-dimensional data; each cell in the matrix is a scatterplot. This example uses Anderson's data of iris flowers on the Gasp√© Peninsula. Scatterplot matrix design invented by J. A. Hartigan; see also [R](http://www.r-project.org/) and [GGobi](http://www.ggobi.org/). Data on *Iris* flowers collected by Edgar Anderson and published by Ronald Fisher."
